Monolith vs Microservices Now I need to mention that I have been working with different tools including very big monolith software like SCOM (System Center Operations Manager) It is quite powerful solution from Microsoft that is mostly used in On-Prem environments, it is capable to monitor different OS types (Linux/Windows/AIX) and can run custom workloads and scripts written in various languages - powershell, bash, perl etc, additionally there are ready to use Management Packs for some specific solutions like SharePoint for instance, but the community is pretty much non-existent.</description></item><item><title>Lift off!
